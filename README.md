This project is named "STATICO". In order to run this program, you need to install the following modules:

```
PortAudio
PyAudio
SpeechRecognition
```

If the program is not recognizing your voice, then you need to change the threshold frequency and ambient noise value. Additionally, you may need to install the 
> webbrowser 
or
> wikipedia 
modules in some cases.

If you need any help or have any errors, please email me at nikhilmatta45@gmail.com.

I hope you enjoy using this program!
